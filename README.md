=====================

Shows some common concepts used when developing a single page application with AngularJS

- use angular templating to do client side templating
- using angular module system with namespace objects to not pollute the DOM
- testing of model and controller with the Jasmine test framework including mocks
- use of simple client-side URL routing to controller and matching template
- angular two-way databinding between model and view
- separation of concern by deviding responsibilities between a model and a controller object
